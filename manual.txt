Welcome to the VPU manual!
(c compilers known to work for this project are clang, cl and gcc,
but i see no reason why any compiler won't work).

This manual is divided in 4 sections:
section 1 (build and use): contains information about building and using the executables.
section 2 (assembly): information about the assembly language for the VPU
section 3 (byte code): how the program is structured.
section 4 (TODO: API): when finnished, will contain information about the API's for the Virtual Machine.


Section 1: Build And Use

    Requirements: standard c library
    To use the Virtual Machine you need to compile your assembly code to the custom VPU byte code,
    this is done through our custom assembler.
    To build the executable simply compile the src/virtual.c file using a c compiler of your
    choice.
	Use the virtual executable like so: virtual [options] <input>
    this will either assemble assembly program in <input> to byte code, disassemble byte code in <input> or execute byte code in <input>
    options are:
        --help:         displays this help message
        --version:      displays current version
        --inst:         displays instructions desciptions and examples
        -assemble:      assemble mode
        -disassemble:   disassemble mode
        -execute:       execute mode
        -debug:         debug mode
        -o <output>:    choose <output> as output file
        -i <input>:     choose <input> as input file
        -args:          marks the beggining of the arguments to pass to executable
        -0:             pass no argument to virtual machine
        -no_export_labels: assembled executable/library will not include labels still defined by the end of the code


Section 2: Assembly (VASM)

    To write programs to the VPU you can use our custom assembly!
    VASM has a set of instructions you can use to do virtually anything,
    each instruction has a fixed size of 4 bytes and takes up to three arguments,
    each argument can be a register, a literal or either of them, literal arguments take 2 bytes,
    register arguments take 1 byte and instructions that take either use 2 bytes to store the value
    and an extra byte for storing if the value was a literal or register,
    the first byte is always the opcode.

    registers:
        Registers name don't differentiate between uppercase and lower case RX is equivalent to
        rX and Rx and rx.
        R0, RA to RZ, RSP and RIP are 64 bit registers, you can put a number from 0 to 7
        immediately after a register identifier to take a subregister starting from that byte offset,
        for example RD4 is a subregister that starts at the address of RD + 4. You can use subregisters
        as 8, 16, 32 or 64 bit registers, but it is worth noting that taking some subregisters with some sizes
        may lead into manipulation of more than one register at once (which can be good or bad). The size of
        the register that will be used is determined by the instructions.
        Special registers are:
            R0: 
                the zero register, this register always holds the value 0, ALWAYS!
                It is very usefull in some instructions as it serves as a dummy argument.
            RSP:
                the register that holds the stack position
            RIP:
                the register that holds the instruction position

    instructions documentation notation:
        R<n>:
            stands for the <n>th argument which is a register in this case
        L<n>:
            stands for the <n>th argument which is a literal in this case
        E:
            stands for the only argument which can be either a literal or a register
        STACK:
            refers to the stack (64 bit)
        STACK_POINTER:
            the pointer to the beggining of the stack
        suffixes:
            the .as_<type> suffix indicates that the value is to be read as the <type>,
            which also means that if the argument is a register it only needs sizeof(<type>) bytes.
            the .<size> suffix indicates that only the first <size> less significant bits will be taken into account
            if no suffix is provided the default is .64 for registers and .16 for literals (as literals have to be up to 16 bit,
            saved for the case of the LOAD1 and LOAD2 arguments)
        instructions are documentaded below as follows:
            <instruction identifier>:
                <description>
            the <instruction identifier> is the same that should be used in the assembly code, the description
            decribes the functionality of the instruction using the notation above and, through it, the arguments
            taken by the instruction are immediately clear,
            for example:
                GET:
                    R1 = STACK[RSP - L2.as_uint16]
                indicates that the instruction takes a register and a literal (in this order) as arguments,
                and it writes the value located at RSP - L2.as_uint16 (L2.as_uint16 being the passed literal
                with its bits being interpreted as uint16_t) in the stack to the passed register (it is implied
                that the full 64 bit register is used).
        NOTE:
            addition, subtraction and multiplication for integers are done in unsigned style, but as the result
            works if the bits represented a signed integer as well (except for overflow which is undefined
            behaviour anyways) only one instruction is needed for each of this operations for each size.

    Subsection labels
        labels are a way to use compile time definitions and values. To create a label you can
        put a ':' symbol after it and the current instruction position will be labeled as that symbol,
        if the label starts with '.' it will be taken as a local label, local labels are auto removed whenever
        a new (not local and instruction) label appears, you can only jump down to local labels.
        Alternatively you can use the %label and %labelv macros (see subsection macros), this will not auto remove local labels.
        To access the label's definition you can preffix it with '$' to get the actual value or, in the case of a label
        defined as a number, you can preffix it with '@' to get the value relative to the current instruction position
        (good for the JMP, JMPF, JMPFN and CALL instructions), local labels only support '@' references. STATIC_SIZE is
        a label that is automatically added for you and contains the current static memory byte size at that point in compilation.
        example:
            loop:
                ;; conditional jump to .loop_end
                JMPF RA @.loop_end

                ;; code...

                ;; jumps to label 'loop'
                JMP @loop
            .loop_end:
            ;; new not local label, this will clean all local labels, so .loop_end will be removed and can now be relabeled
            new_label:
        example:
            %label value 5
            MOVV RA $value
            ;; moves the value 5 to register RA

    Subsection macros
        all macros should start with the % character.
        %start:
            marks the entry point of the program, if there are multiple of this the last one is taken
        %include:
            includes a file in the passed string argument path relative to the current one (c style),
            example usage: %include "dir/file.txt"
        %label:
            creates a new label with the given value, you can NOT create a label that already exists
            in that case you can use %unlabel to unlabel it and then label again to something else
        %labelv:
            creates a dummy label, i.e a label without a definition
        %unlabel:
            removes a label
        %iflabel:
            parsers the code enclosed by this %iflabel and its respective %endif
            if the following symbol is labeled
        %ifnlabel:
            parsers the code enclosed by this %ifnlabel and its respective %endif
            if the following symbol is not labeled
        %endif:
            marks the end of a macro if
        %enum:
            labels a sequence of tokens as ordered numbers, you can set any specific element with =,
            commas ',' are optional, all %enum can be closed with %endenum
            example:
                %enum
                    LABEL0 = 0,
                    LABEL1
                    LABEL2,
                    LABEL_ = -8
                %endenum
        %static:
            pushes the following data to the static memory



Section 3: Byte Code
    The program binary data starts with a 4 bytes magic number "VPU:", the padding bytes count (4 bytes),
    the flags (8 bytes), the entry point position (relative to the beginning of the byte code) (8 bytes),
    the meta data size (8 bytes), the meta data (meta data size bytes), padding bytes (padding bytes count bytes)
    and the byte code. The padding bytes are needed to garantee the alignment of the byte code to 8 bytes.

    Subsection meta data:
        The meta data consists of blocks of memory with an 8 byte number for the total size
        of the memory block (including the number) and an 8 byte number to identify the block,
        the only memory block for now is the static memory, memory identified with an 8 bytes
        number "STATIC:\0" it contains the static memory of the program.

    Each instruction has a fixed size of 4 bytes the first byte is the opcode, the other 3 bytes
    are for the arguments or hints, literal arguments take 2 bytes where registers take 1, they are
    placed in order in the instruction (opcode, arg1, arg2, arg3/hint). Hints are always placed in
    the last byte and indicate if the the argument is a literal or a register for instructions that
    can take either of them.


Section 4: API's

    The VPU will eventually have API's, but this is not done yet...
