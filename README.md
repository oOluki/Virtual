# Virtual
Virtual is project that aims to build a very complete virtual machine as well as an API for handling its perks.

Virtual Processing Unit:
    Virtual Processing Unit (VPU) is designed to be a simple virtual machine compatiple with multiple platforms. This virtual machine has both registers and a stack and it's inspired by actual CPU assemblies and architectures (to some extent) such as ARM. This is the heart of the project and everything else will gravitate around it.
API's:
    TODO: make an API for using this virtual machine in a browser
