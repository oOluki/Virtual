# Virtual_Processing_Unit
Virtual_Processing_Unit (VPU) is designed to be a simple virtual machine compatiple with multiple platforms.

this virtual machine has both registers and a stack, it's inspired by actual CPU assemblies such as X86_64.

To build this simply compile the compiler.c and vpu.c files separately, use the first executable to compile files into binary executables for the second executable to run,
additionaly you can compile the decompile.c file to be able to decompile the binary executables created by the VPU compiler.
